# Trait Objects & Dynamic Dispatch

---

## Trait... Object?

- We learned about [traits](#traits-and-generics).
- We learned about generics and `monomorphization`.

There's more to this story though...

**Question**: What was monomorphization again?

---

## Monomorphization (recap)

The [`Add`](#the-trait-keyword/1) trait.

::::::{.columns}

:::{.column width="50%"}

```rust
impl Add for i32 {/* ... */}
impl Add for f32 {/* ... */}

fn add_values<T: Add>(l: &T, r: &T) -> T
{
  l.add(r)
}

fn main() {
  let sum_one = add_values(&6, &8);
  let sum_two = add_values(&6.5, &7.5);
}
```

:::

:::{.column width="50%"}

Code is <em>monomorphized</em>:

::: incremental

- Two versions of `add_values` end up in binary.
- Optimized separately and very fast to run (static dispatch).
- Slow to compile and larger binary.

:::

:::

::::::

---

## Dynamic Dispatch

_What if don't know the concrete type implementing the trait at compile time?_

::::::{.columns}

:::{.column width="48%"}

```rust {line-numbers="all|1-8|10-12" style="font-size:14pt"}
use std::io::Write;
use std::path::PathBuf;

struct FileLogger { log_file: PathBuf }
impl Write for FileLogger { /* ... */}

struct StdOutLogger;
impl Write for StdOutLogger { /* ... */}

fn log<L: Write>(logger: &mut L, msg: &str) {
  write!(logger, "{}", msg);
}
```

:::

:::{.column width="50%"}

```rust {line-numbers="2|4-7|9" style="font-size:14pt"}
fn main() {
  let file: Option<PathBuf> = // args parsing...

  let mut logger = match file {
      Some(f) => FileLogger { log_file: f },
      None => StdOutLogger,
  };

  log(&mut logger, "Hello, world!ü¶Ä");
}
```

## Dynamically Sized Types (DST)

Rust supports **Dynamically Sized Types** (DSTs): types **without a statically
known size or alignment**.

On the surface,
[this is a bit nonsensical](https://doc.rust-lang.org/nomicon/exotic-sizes.html):
`rustc` always needs to know the size and alignment to compile code!

::: incremental

- [`Sized`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/marker/trait.Sized.html) is a
  **marker** trait for types with know-size at compile time.

- Types in Rust can be `Sized` or `!Sized` (unsized Ó™ú DSTs).

:::

---

## Examples of `Sized` vs. `!Sized`

::: incremental

- Most types are `Sized`, and **automatically** marked as such

  - `i64`
  - `String`
  - `Vec<String>`
  - etc.

- Two major DSTs (`!Sized`) exposed by the language (**note the absence of a
  reference!**):

  - Trait Objects: `dyn MyTrait` (covered in the next section)
  - Slices: `[T]`, `str`, and others.

- DSTs can be **only** be used (local variable) **through a reference**: `&[T]`,
  `&str`, `&dyn MyTrait` (references are `Sized`).

:::

:::notes

Pointers, which essentially references (`&str`) are, always have a known size at
compile, time that is why they can be stored in local variables (which as you
know live on the stack).

:::

---

## Trait Objects `dyn Trait`

::: incremental

- Opaque type that implements a set of traits.

  Type Description: `dyn MyTrait: !Sized`

- Like slices, trait objects **always live behind pointers** (`&dyn MyTrait`,
  `&mut dyn MyTrait`, `Box<dyn MyTrait>`, `...`).

- Concrete underlying types are erased from trait object.

:::

```rust{line-numbers="5|6-8" .fragment}
fn main() {
  let log_file: Option<PathBuf> = // ...

  // Create a trait object that implements `Write`
  let logger: &mut dyn Write = match log_file {
    Some(log_file) => &mut FileLogger { log_file },
    None => &mut StdOutLogger,
  };
}
```

---

## Quiz - Instantiate a Trait?

```rust {contenteditable="true"}
struct A{}
trait MyTrait { fn show(&self) {}; }
impl MyTrait for A {}

fn main() {
  let a: MyTrait = A{};
  let b: dyn MyTrait = A{};
}
```

**Question:** Does that compile?

::: {.fragment }

**Answer: No! - It's invalid code.**

::: incremental

- You can't declare a local variable `a`, `MyTrait` **is not a type**.
- You can't declare `b` as `dyn MyTrait`, because for the type system its
  `!Sized` Ó™ú **can't compute size of memory of `b` on the stack**.
- _Also: You can't pass the value of an unsized type into a function as an
  argument or return it from a function._

:::

:::

---

## Generics and `Sized` : How?

::: incremental

- Given a concrete type you can always say if its `Sized` or `!Sized` (DST).

- Whats with generics?

```rust {.fragment}
fn generic_fn<T: Eq>(x: T) -> T { /*..*/ }
```

- If `T` is `Sized`, all is OK!.

- If `T` is `!Sized`, then the definition of `generic_fn` is incorrect! (why?)

:::

::: notes

It is incorrect because, you take a `T` which needs to be constructed on the
stack ergo have a fixed-size at compile time! You also return a `T` which needs
to have a fixed-size at compile time (also on the stack frame).

:::

---

## Generics and `Sized`

- All **generic type parameters** are **implicitly** `Sized` by default
  (everywhere `structs`, `fn`s etc.):

  For example:

  ```rust {.fragment}
  fn generic_fn<T: Eq + Sized>(x: T) -> T { // Sized is obsolete here.
    //...
  }
  ```

  or

  ```rust {.fragment}
  fn generic_fn<T>(x: &T) -> u32
  where
      T: Eq + Sized // Sized is obsolete here.
  {
    // ...
  }
  ```

---

## Generics and `?Sized`

Sometimes we want to opt-out of `Sized`: use `?Sized`:

```rust
fn generic_fn<T: Eq + ?Sized>(x: &T) -> u32 { ... }
```

::: incremental

- In English: `?Sized` means `T` also allows for dyn. sized types (DST) Ó™ú e.g.
  `T := dyn Eq`.

- So a `x: &dyn Eq` is a reference to a **trait object** which implements
  [`Eq`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/cmp/trait.Eq.html).

:::

---

## Generics and `?Sized` - Quiz

Does that compile? Why?/Why not?

```rust
fn generic_fn<T: Eq + ?Sized>(x: &T) -> u32 { 42 }

fn main() {
  generic_fn("hello world")`
}
```

::: {.fragment}

**Answer:** `generic_fn` is instantiated with `&str`:

::: incremental

- Ó™ú match `&T <-> &str`
- Ó™ú `T := str`
- Ó™ú `x: &str` which is `Sized`
- Ó™ú ‚úÖ Yes it compiles.

:::

:::

---

## Generics and `?Sized` - Quiz

Does that compile? Why?/Why not?

```rust {line-numbers=}
// removed the reference ------- v
fn generic_fn<T: Eq + ?Sized>(x: T) -> u32 { 42 }

fn main() {
  generic_fn("hello world");
}
```

::: {.fragment}

**Answer:** ‚ùå No - declaration `generic_fn` is invalid (line 5 is not the
problem!):

::: incremental

- `T` can **potentially** be `dyn Eq` Ó™ú leads to `x: dyn Eq` which is not
  `Sized` Ó™ú compile error.
- [**Remember: function parameter go onto the stack!**]{.emph}

:::

:::

::: notes

The compile error has nothing to do with the call in 5!

:::

## Generics and `?Sized` - Quiz (Tip)

How to print the type `T`?

::::::::{.columns}

:::{.column width="50%"}

```rust
fn generic_fn<T: Eq>(x: T) -> u32 {
    42
}

fn main() {
    generic_fn("hello world");
}
```

:::

:::{.column width="50%" .fragment}

```rust
fn generic_fn<T: Eq + std::fmt::Display>(x: T) -> u32 {
    println!(
      "x: {} = '{x}'",
      std::any::type_name::<T>());

    42
}

fn main() {
    generic_fn("hello world");
}
```

```
x: &str = 'hello world'
```

## Dynamic Dispatch on the Stack

::::::{.columns}

:::{.column width="50%"}

```rust {style="font-size:14pt;"}
/// Same code as last slide
fn main() {
  let log_file: Option<PathBuf> = //...

  // Create a trait object that implements `Write`
  let logger: &mut dyn Write = match log_file {
    Some(log_file) => &mut FileLogger{log_file},
    None => &mut StdOutLogger,
  };

  log(&mut logger, "Hello World!");
}
```

:::

:::{.column width="50%" .p-no-margin}

![](${meta:include-base-dir}/assets/images/A1-trait-object-layout.svgbob){.svgbob}

:::

::::::

::: incremental

- üí∏ **Cost**: pointer indirection via vtable (**dynamic dispatch**) Ó™ú less
  performant.
- üí∞ **Benefit**: no monomorphization (generics) Ó™ú smaller binary & shorter
  compile time!
- üíª **Memory**: `logger` is a **wide-pointer** which lives **only** on the
  **stack** Ó™ú üöÄ.

:::

::: notes

Its called wide-pointer because you have a pointer to data and a pointer to the
vtable with the functions. Do not think about the pointer indirection, and less
performant -> this is 100% premature optimization!

:::

---

## Dynamic Dispatch on the Heap

::::::{.columns}

:::{.column width="55%"}

```rust {style="font-size:14pt;"}
/// Same code as last slide
fn main() {
  let log_file: Option<PathBuf> = //...

  // Create a trait object on heap that impl. `Write`
  let logger: Box<dyn Write> = match log_file {
    Some(log_file) => Box::new(FileLogger{log_file}),
    None => Box::new(StdOutLogger),
  };

  log("Hello, world!ü¶Ä", &mut logger);
}
```

:::

:::{.column width="45%" .p-no-margin}

![](${meta:include-base-dir}/assets/images/A1-trait-object-layout-heap.svgbob){.svgbob}

:::

::::::

::: incremental

- üí∏ **Cost**: same as before.
- üí∞ **Benefit**: same as before.
- üíª **Memory**: `logger` is a smart-pointer where the data and vtable is on the
  **heap** (dyn. mem. allocation Ó™ú üêå, **this is fine 99% time**)

:::

::: notes

A boxed dyn. Trait is totally fine and most of the time easier to deal with in
code. The dynamic memory allocation should not be your premature optimization
point! The pointer indirection is the same as in the stack-based dynamic
dispatch, do not think about this, it is 80% premature optimization. Except you
are in a very very very hot loop where you do dynamic dispatch always, then
think about it, in all other cases dont!.

:::

---

## Fixing Dynamic Logger

- Trait objects `&dyn Trait`, `Box<dyn Trait>`, ... implement `Trait`!

```rust {line-numbers="all|9-13|1-4"}
// L no longer must be `Sized`, so to accept trait objects.
fn log<L: Write + ?Sized>(entry: &str, logger: &mut L) {
    write!(logger, "{}", entry);
}

fn main() {
    let log_file: Option<PathBuf> = // ...

    // Create a trait object that implements `Write`
    let logger: &mut dyn Write = match log_file {
        Some(log_file) => &mut FileLogger { log_file },
        None => &mut StdOutLogger,
    };
    log("Hello, world!ü¶Ä", logger);
}
```

And all is well!

## Forcing Dynamic Dispatch

If one wants to enforce API users to use dynamic dispatch, use `&mut dyn Write`
on `log`:

```rust
fn log(entry: &str, logger: &mut dyn Write) {
    write!(logger, "{}", entry);
}

fn main() {
    let log_file: Option<PathBuf> = // ...

    // Create a trait object that implements `Write`
    let logger: &mut dyn Write = match log_file {
        Some(log_file) => &mut FileLogger { log_file },
        None => &mut StdOutLogger,
    };

    log("Hello, world!ü¶Ä", &mut logger);
}
```

---

## Heterogeneous Collection on the Heap

::::::{.columns}

:::{.column width="45%"}

```rust {.no-compile}
fn main() {
  let mut shapes = Vec::new();


  let circle = Circle;
  shapes.push(circle);

  let rect = Rectangle;
  shapes.push(rect);

  shapes.iter()
        .for_each(|s| s.paint());
}
```

:::

:::{.column width="55%" .fragment}

```rust{line-numbers="2,3,5,8" .does-compile}
fn main() {
  let mut shapes: Vec<Box<dyn Render>>
    = Vec::new();

  let circle = Box::new(Circle);
  shapes.push(circle);

  let rect = Box::new(Rectangle);
  shapes.push(rect);

  shapes.iter()
        .for_each(|s| s.paint());
}
```

:::

::::::

All set!

---

## Heterogeneous Collection on the Stack üç≠

```rust
fn main() {
    let shapes: [&dyn Render; 2] = [&Circle {}, &Rectangle {}];
    shapes.iter().for_each(|shape| shape.paint());
}
```

All set!

---

## Trait Object Limitations

- Pointer indirection cost.
- Harder to debug.
- Type erasure (you need a trait).

- Not **all traits** work:

  [**Traits need to be _dyn-compatible_ **]{.emph}

---

## dyn-compatible Objects

A trait is **dyn-compatbile** (formerly "object safe") when it fulfills:

- Trait `T` must not be `Sized`: _Why?_
- If `trait T: Y`, then`Y` must be dyn-compatible.
- No associated constants allowed.
- No associated types with generic allowed.
- All associated functions must either be dispatchable from a trait object, or
  explicitly non-dispatchable:
  - e.g. function must have a receiver with a reference to `Self`

Details in
[The Rust Reference](https://doc.rust-lang.org/reference/items/traits.html#object-safety).
Read them!

These seem to be compiler limitations.

---

## Non-dyn-compatible Trait (üò±)

```rust {line-numbers="1-4|6|8-13|16-19"}
trait Fruit {
  fn create(&self) -> Self;
  fn show(&self) -> String;
}

struct Banana { color: i32 }

impl Fruit for Banana {
  fn create(&self) -> Self { Banana {} }

  fn show(&self) -> String {
      return format!("banana: color {}", self.color).to_string();
  }
}

fn main() {
    let obj: Box<dyn Fruit> = Box::new(Banana { color: 10 });
    println!("type: {}", obj.show())
}
```

---

## Non-dyn-compatible Traits (üí©)

```text

   |                          ^^^^^^^^^^ `Fruit` cannot be made into an object

note: for a trait to be "dyn-compatible" it needs to 
      allow building a vtable to allow the call to be
      resolvable dynamically; for more information
      visit <https://doc.rust-lang.org/reference/items/traits.html#object-safety>

                                the `Self` type in its return type
```

---

## Trait Object Summary

- Trait objects allow for dynamic dispatch and heterogeneous containers.
- Trait objects introduce pointer indirection.
- Traits need to be dyn-compatible to make trait objects out of them.
