# Creating a Nice API

:::notes

    A big part of developing a larger project is to define a nice, readable API that clarifies intent. Let's have a look at some guidelines Rust specifies in order to make crates useful for others or even future you.

## Rust API Guidelines

::::::{.columns}

:::{.column width="50%"}

- Defined by the Rust project
- [Checklist available](https://rust-lang.github.io/api-guidelines/checklist.html)
  (Link in exercises).

**Read the checklist, use it!**

:::notes

To improve consistency between crates, Rust defines a whole lot of guidelines.
There's even a checklist available. In this section, we'll focus on some
guidelines. However, make sure to use the checklist for all code you write in
exercises!

## General Recommendations

Make your API

- Unsurprising
- Flexible
- Obvious

**Next up: Some low-hanging fruits**

:::notes

In general, you want to make your API unsurprising, flexible and obvious.

- An unsurprising API uses patterns that are broadly used, allowing the user to
  guess how the interface is structured.
- Flexible APIs are suitable for many applications, and only as restrictive as
  they inherently need to be.
- Make your API obvious to enable users to quickly understand rules of your
  library.

## Make your API - Unsurprising

:::notes

So, how to make your API unsurprising?

:::

## Naming your Methods

::::::{.columns}

:::{.column width="%"}

```rust {line-numbers="|7-10|12-15"}
pub struct S {
  first: First,
  second: Second,
}

impl S {
  // Not get_first.
  pub fn first(&self) -> &First {
      &self.first
  }

  // Not get_first_mut, get_mut_first, or mut_first.
  pub fn first_mut(&mut self) -> &mut First {
      &mut self.first
  }
}
```

:::

:::{.column width="50%"}

Other example: conversion methods `as_`, `to_`, `into_`, name depends on:

- Runtime cost
- Owned â‡” Borrowed

:::

::::::

:::notes

An easy way of making your API unsurprising is by adhering to naming
conventions.

- For example, the guidelines specify a naming convention for getters. Note that
  getter names do not start with `get`, and that the mutable getter ends with
  `mut`.
- Another example is the way conversion methods are named, based on their
  runtime cost and whether the conversion is between references, owned values,
  or from reference to owned and vice-versa.

## Implement/Derive Common Traits

_As long as it makes sense_ public types should implement:

::::::{.columns}

:::{.column width="50%"}

- `Copy`
- `Clone`
- `Eq`
- `PartialEq`
- `Ord`
- `PartialOrd`

:::

:::{.column width="50%"}

- `Hash`
- `Debug`
- `Display`
- `Default`
- `serde::Serialize`
- `serde::Deserialize`

:::

::::::

:::notes

Here's a list of common traits to implement or derive automatically, making your
types more useful to others.

:::

---

## Make your API - Flexible

:::notes

Now, let's take a look at some ways to make your API flexible

:::

---

## Use Generics

```rust {line-numbers="|1-3|5-9"}
pub fn add(x: u32, y: u32) -> u32 {
    x + y
}

/// Adds two values that implement the `Add` trait,
/// returning the specified output
pub fn add_generic<O, T: std::ops::Add<Output = O>>(x: T, y: T) -> O {
    x + y
}
```

:::notes

An great way to lift restrictions on your API is to write your functions in
terms of traits. That is, use generics to describe what exactly is needed to
perform a certain action.

- In this example, the first function only accepts `u32`, whereas there are many
  other numeric types for which addition makes sense.
- The second example, though, accepts anything for which the `Add` trait is
  implemented. It is even generic over the addition output.

:::

---

## Accept Borrowed Data (if possible)

- User decides whether calling function should own the data.
- Avoids unnecessary moves.
- Exception: **non-large** array `Copy` types

```rust {line-numbers="|6-9|11-14"}
/// Some very large struct
pub struct LargeStruct {
    data: [u8; 4096],
}

/// Takes owned [LargeStruct] and returns it when done. This is costly!
pub fn manipulate_large_struct(mut large: LargeStruct) -> LargeStruct {
    todo!()
}

/// Just borrows [LargeStruct]. This is cheap!
pub fn manipulate_large_struct_borrowed(large: &mut LargeStruct) {
    todo!()
}
```

:::notes

An even neater way to make your API flexible is by allowing the user to decide
whether the data that is passed to your function is owned by the calling
function or not. This is done by accepting borrowed data wherever possible. This
avoids unnecessary moves. An exception to this guideline is for non-large `Copy`
types, as they are cheap to clone.

- The first function in the example moves the `LargeStruct` into its own scope,
  and then moves it out again. That may be costly and requires ownership from
  calling function!
- The second function merely borrows the `LargeStruct`, which is cheap and
  flexible.

## Make your API - Obvious

:::notes

Lastly, we'll make our APIs obvious

:::

---

## Write Rustdoc

::::::{.columns}

:::{.column width="60%"}

- Use 3 forward-slashes to start a doc comment.
- You can add code examples, too.
- To open docs in your browser: `cargo doc --open`

````rust
/// A well-documented struct.
/// ```rust
/// # // lines starting with a `#` are hidden
/// # use ex_b::MyDocumentedStruct;
/// let my_struct = MyDocumentedStruct {
///     field: 1,
/// };
/// println!("{:?}", my_struct.field);
/// ```
pub struct MyDocumentedStruct {
    /// A field with data
    pub field: u32,
}
````

:::

:::{.column width="40%"}

![](${meta:include-base-dir}/assets/images/A2-rustdoc.png){}

:::

::::::

:::notes

Lots of respect for authors of good documentation! If you find writing
documentation hard, keep in mind that you may be writing this for your future
self.

- A doc comment in Rust starts with three forward-slashes
- You can add code examples, which can even be tested automatically to ensure
  they're not out of date after a refactor.
- Using `cargo doc --open`, you can render documentation locally and open it in
  your browser. Here's how it looks: [see image]

## Include Examples

Create examples to show users how to use your library

```bash {line-numbers="all"}
tree
.
â”œâ”€â”€ Cargo.lock
â”œâ”€â”€ Cargo.toml
â”œâ”€â”€ examples
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ say_hello.rs
â””â”€â”€ src
    â””â”€â”€ lib.rs
```

```bash
cargo run --example say_hello
...
Hello, henkdieter!
```

:::notes

- If you're writing a library, adding a couple of examples helps your users get
  started. In fact, many libraries are accompanied with examples defined in
  their Git repositories.
- Run examples with the `--example` option, specifying the binary

:::

---

## Use Semantic Typing (1) {id="url-example"}

Make the type system work for you!

```rust {line-numbers="all|1-2|7-8"}
/// Fetch a page from passed URL
fn load_page(url: &str) -> String {
    todo!("Fetch");
}

fn main() {
  let page = load_page("https://teach-rs.tweede.golf");
  let crab = load_page("ðŸ¦€"); // Ouch!
}
```

_`&str` is not restrictive enough: not all `&str` represent correct URLs_

:::notes

Rusts type system is awesome. Use it to you advantage by embedding semantics
into your types.

- As an example, the `load_page` function takes a string slice, indicating the
  URL of the page that it should load.
- At the call site of load_page, it's unclear what a page even is (memory page?
  remote content?)
- `load_page` accepts all strings, even strings that do not represent valid URLs

:::

---

## Use Semantic Typing (2)

::::::{.columns}

:::{.column width="50%"}

```rust {line-numbers="all|1-3,14-16|5-12,22-24|18-20|all"}
struct Url<'u> {
  url: &'u str,
}

impl<'u> Url<'u> {
  fn new(url: &'u str) -> Self {
    if !valid(url) {
      panic!("URL invalid: {}", url);
    }
    Self { url }
  }
}
fn valid(url: &str) -> bool {
  url != "ðŸ¦€"
}
```

:::

:::{.column width="50%"}

```rust
fn load_page(remote: Url) -> String {
    todo!("load it");
}
fn main() {
    // Not good
    let c = load_page(Url::new("ðŸ¦€"));
}
```

```txt
thread 'main' panicked at
'URL invalid: ðŸ¦€', src/main.rs:11:7
note: run with `RUST_BACKTRACE=1` ...
```

:::incremental

- Clear intent.
- Validate inputs: security!
- **Use the [`url`](https://lib.rs/url) crate.**

:::

:::

::::::

:::notes

- The `Url` struct defined here, wraps a string slice, but has a name that
  clarifies intent at the call site
- what's more, the `Url` struct can only be instantiated with strings that
  represent valid URLs

cargo clippy
cargo fmt
```

Use the state-of-the-art
[repository-template `rust`](https://github.com/sdsc-ordes/repository-template).
