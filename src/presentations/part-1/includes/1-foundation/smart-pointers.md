# Smart Pointers

---

## What is a Smart Pointer?

- A wrapper type which manages a type `T`
- `T` is allocated on the heap.

---

## Single Ownership - [`Box<T>`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/boxed/struct.Box.html)

[`Box<T>`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/boxed/struct.Box.html) will allocate a
type `T` on the heap and wrap the pointer underneath:

::::::{.columns}

:::{.column width="50%"}

```rust
fn main() {
  // Put an integer on the heap
  let boxed_int: Box<i64> = Box::new(10);
}
```

:::

:::{.column width="50%"}

::: {.center-content .p-no-margin}

- üß∞ **Boxing**: Store a type `T` on the heap.

::: incremental

- üëë `Box` **uniquely owns** that value. Nobody else does.
- üß∫ A `Box` variable will deallocate the memory when out-of-scope.
- üöÇ Move semantics apply to a `Box`. Even if the type inside the box is `Copy`.

## When to use `Box<T>`?

Reasons to box a type `T` on the heap:

::: incremental

- When something is too large to move around ‚è±Ô∏è.

- Need something dynamically sized (`dyn Trait` later).

- You need single ownership.

- For writing recursive data structures:

  ```rust {.fragment}
  struct Node {
    data: Vec<u8>,
    parent: Box<Node>,
  }
  ```

:::

::: notes

- Allowing arbitrarily large values on the stack would quickly let our function
  calls exhaust the stack limit

  - Especially if a move actually would involve memcopying the bits to another
    location in memory that would take way too long

- Of course the main reason that a vector uses the heap is to be able to be
  sized dynamically, but even so, a vector can be large, whereas an array will
  generally always have a limited size

## Shared Ownership - [`Arc<T>`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/sync/struct.Arc.html)

An [`Arc<T>`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/sync/struct.Arc.html)
(**A**tomic-**R**eference-**C**ounted)

::::::{.columns}

:::{.column width="55%" style="align-content:center;"}

- allows shared ownership of a value of type `T`.
- inner value `T` allocated on the heap.
- disallows mutation of the inner value `T` (more in the docs).

:::{.column width="45%"}

## Shared Ownership - [`Arc<T>`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/sync/struct.Arc.html) (2)

```rust {line-numbers="4|7|11|12|15"}
use std::sync::Arc;

fn main() {
    let data = Arc::new(vec![1, 2, 3]);

    {
      let data_other = data.clone();
      // Is always a cheap pointer copy
      // and does not copy the Vec!

      println!("Owners: {}", Arc::strong_count(&data));
      println!("Data: {:?}", data_other)
    }

} // data is last owner -> deallocated heap memory.
```
