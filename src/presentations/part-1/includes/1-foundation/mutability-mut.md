## The `mut` Keyword in More Detail

A variable

```rust
let a = ... // bind a to some memory on the stack ...
```

is a _binding_ to some place in memory, and is used to read/write from/into that
place.

#### `mut` Bindings

The `mut` modifier applies to the binding itself, **not** the memory it binds
to:

```rust
let ptr1 = _ox
