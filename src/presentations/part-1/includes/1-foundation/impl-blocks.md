# Implementation Blocks `impl`

---

## Implementing Member Functions

To associate functions to `structs` and `enums`, we use `impl` blocks

```rust
fn main() {
  let x = "Hello";
  x.len();
}
```

- Syntax `x.len()` similar to field access in `struct`s.

---

## The `impl` Block (2)

:::::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="40%"}

```rust {line-numbers="6-10,14"}
struct Banana
{
  size: f64;
}

impl Banana {
  fn get_volume(&self) -> f64 {
    return self.size * self.size * 1.5;
  }
}

fn main() {
  let b = Banana{size: 4};
  let v = b.get_volume();
}
```

:::

:::{.column style="width:50%; align-content:center;"}

- Functions can be defined on our types using `impl` blocks.

- Implementation blocks possible on any type, not just `struct`s (with
  exceptions).

:::

::::::

::: notes

- Here we define the get_volume method
- Note how the impl block is separate from the type definition.
- In fact we can have multiple impl blocks for the same type, as long as
  function definitions do not overlap (not useful right now, but it will be once
  we get more into generics)

## The `self` & `Self`: Implementation

- `self` parameter: the **_receiver_** on which a function is defined.
- `Self` type: **_shorthand for the type_** of current implementation.

:::::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="55%"}

```rust {line-numbers="all|4|6-8|11|14-16" style="font-size:14pt"}
struct Banana { size: f64; }

impl Banana {
    fn new(i: f64) -> Self { Self { size: i } }

    fn consume(self) -> Self {
        Self::new(self.size - 5.0)
    }
    // Take read reference of `Banana` instance.
    fn borrow(&self) -> &f64 { &self.size }
    // Take write reference of `Banana` instance.
    fn borrow_mut(&mut self) -> &mut f64 {
        &mut self.size
    }
}
```

:::

::: {.column style="width:45%; align-content:center;"}

::: incremental

- Absence of a `self` parameter means its an **_associated function_** on that
  type (e.g. `new`).
- `self` is always first argument and its always the type on which `impl` is
  defined (type not needed).
- Prepend `&` or `&mut ` to `self` to indicate that we take a value by
  reference.

## The `self` & `Self`: Application

```rust
fn main () {
  let mut f = Banana::new();
  println!("{}", f.borrow());

  *f.borrow_mut() = 10;

  let g = f.consume();
  println!("{}", g.borrow());
}
```
